# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a collection of programming puzzles released daily throughout December. There is also an associated competitive aspect to these puzzles; you get a rank (and points) based on how fast you submit a correct solution, starting from the time the puzzle is released.

Many of these puzzles were done under this time constraint, and the code reflects this. It was almost always fastest to do the easiest thing, even if it meant more repetitive code; also, as long as the code ran in a reasonable time, it was usually not worth optimizing for time or memory complexity. 

Occasionally, I went back to tidy up variable names, optimize for complexity, and add comments about what I was trying to do and how the challenge went. I've generally noted if I did this in the comments where appropriate.
